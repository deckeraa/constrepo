Constrepo
=========

Constrepo (latin) -- buzz

Constrepo is a webapp for generating names and tasks entirely from
software-engineering buzzwords.
Inspiration for this program came from such things as "Code-first Entity Framework"
and "Enterprise Architect".

The main purpose of this program was for me to play around with couchapps to gain
a familiarity with the platform.
